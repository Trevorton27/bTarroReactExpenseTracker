## Summary

WIP

<!-- This app was written using basic HTML (canvas), CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries). The focus of this project was to build a snake game with an ultra-responsive snake and a retro arcade feel. -->

<!-- Features:

- Super smooth snake movement and controls
- score / high-score keeping
- 'start / attraction' screen
- 'Game Over' screen
- Variable tunables (Speed, growth, point value, etc)

In the future versions I'd like to:

- refactor the logic
- Store "high-score" beyond the current session
- Add 'mode-select' and give users access to some of the tunables -->
